My name is Christopher Dickerson, but I go by Preston. 
I am a Computer Science major at Centre College. I enjoy being 
challenged in my everyday life whether it comes to academics or 
athletics. I thrive in high-pressure situations and am able to 
overcome my obstacles by thinking outside the box.
I have had the opportunity to run Cross Country and Track at
Centre and have some great success!
